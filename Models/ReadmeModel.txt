Real cockpit
============
- blue (instrument panels), white beige (walls) and black (window pillars and sills).
- pilot seat, near the 2nd pillar. As instruments (artificial horizon, ASI) are close, the reading at landing is easy.
- engineer panel seems to cover the 2nd window of copilot.
- overhead panel stops before the engineer panel.
- autopilot height = less than 1/2 of panel height.
- panel height = 1/2 of height to floor (below the panel).


Cockpit Model
=============
The floor is supposed at the same level than the external nose strakes (blade),
which puts it slightly above the bottom of the (textured) doors.


TO DO
=====
- visor well.
- compression of wing gear.
- spin tyre of wing gear.
- external lights.
- afterburner (smoke).
- door (before the avionics racks) to close the cockpit.
- probes on nose, RAT.


Known problems
==============
Removing polygons (mainly the wings) could increase the frame rate : it will be waited for hardware upgrade.

Known problems cockpit
----------------------
- in the engineer view, the autopilot panel is align with the yoke pillars, like in Blender;
  in the captain view, the autopilot panel appears with a right shift (visual effect).


Credits
=======
Concorde model (without 3D cockpit) is from "Bogey" (unknown name and mail).

It has been made available to Flightgear upon a request of M. Franz.
See the forum of http://www.blender.org/, message from "Bogey", subject "Update Concord. Screen shots and download
links" (24 october 2003 6:23 pm).


List of updates to the original model :
- addition of cockpit.
- nose and visor (visibility of visor and nose from cockpit).
- split of nozzles (animation).
- transparent windows.
- alignment of main gear internal doors with their well.


Contact devel-list for the .blend file (Blender 2.36) :
- distinct object group for the cockpit (lost at AC3D export/import).
- which is otherwise very difficult to isolate in the mesh jungle : one needs to eliminate the fuselage to vizualize the
cockpit interior (alternate solution : cockpit in different layer).
