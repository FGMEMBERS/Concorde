Real cockpit
============
- blue (instrument panels), white beige (walls) and black (window pillars and sills).
- pilot seat, near the 2nd pillar. As instruments (artificial horizon, ASI) are close, the reading at landing is easy.
- engineer panel seems to cover the 2nd window of copilot.
- overhead panel stops before the engineer panel.

Known problems aircraft
-----------------------
- since the introduction of 3D cockpit, there is a transparency of the front window edge, visible when the nose is down.
- removing polygons (mainly the wings) will decrease the frame rate. But would it be better to wait for 256 MB cards ?

Known problems cockpit
----------------------
- panel can be too much white, depending of sun location : material and/or Flightgear lightning.

Concorde model (without 3D cockpit) is from "Bogey" (unknown name and mail).
It has been made available to Flightgear upon a request of Melchior Franz.

See the forum of http://www.blender.org/, message from "Bogey", subject "Update Concord. Screen shots and download
links" (24 october 2003 6:23 pm).


Contact devel-list for the .blend file (Blender 2.32) :
- distinct object group for the cockpit (lost at AC3D export/import).
- which is otherwise very difficult to isolate in the mesh jungle : one needs to eliminate the fuselage to vizualize the
cockpit interior.
