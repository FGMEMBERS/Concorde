- most instruments are optimized with "group" and "switch" (except if too complex) :
priority to autoland (high load on CPU), otherwise the most common layer.
- concorde-amber-fault.rgb, black-bg, blue-indicator, green-warning, red-alarm, yellow-warning, white-button
are color templates.
- blue template has enough red to be visible by night lightning.
- specific textures (IVSI, Machmeter, etc ...) are made with Metafont (template by M. Franz);
Gimp adds the alpha layer and the transparent areas.

TO DO
=====
- release the Metafont font files.
