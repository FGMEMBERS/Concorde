     <text>________________________Procedures_________________________
Takeoff (408000 lb): nose 5 degree, afterburner, V1 165 kt, VR 195 kt, pitch 13.5 degree at rotation, V2 220 kt
Subsonic cruise: Mach 0.95
Acceleration: afterburner at Mach 0.93; air intakes starts closing at Mach 1.3; stop afterburner at Mach 1.7
Supersonic cruise: Mach 2.0 at FL500
Landing (245000 lb): nose 12.5 degree, VREF 162 kt, pitch 10 degree at touch down
Taxi: nose 5 degree, only 2 engines

Runway: 11200 ft takeoff, 7300 ft landing
Max climb rate: 5000 ft/s
Range: 3550 nm supersonic, 2760 nm subsonic (Mach 0.95 FL300)
Duration: Paris--New York 3h45, London Heathrow--New York 3h50
Maximum operating altitude: 60000 ft
Maximum total temperature (TMO): 127 deg C on nose.


__________________________Takeoff__________________________
- the visor is raised not long after takeoff, to make cockpit quieter
- the visor protects the windscreen from the 125 deg C temperature at Mach 2

______________________Subsonic cruise______________________
- Mach 0.93 at FL250, or Mach 0.95 at FL260 (full load)

______________________Supersonic climb_____________________
- start afterburner with VS at 3500 ft/minute; then decrease at 2500-1500-1000-700 ft/minute
- at Mach 1.1, drag starts to decrease
- stay inside the corridor of Mach/center of gravity. Below the minimum means a too high altitude for the current Mach speed: accelerate by reducing climb speed
- if required (pressure/temperature) after Mach 1.2, reduce at 100 ft/minute to break the Mach 1.3 final barrier
- at Mach 1.3, air intakes open progressively, providing additional thrust. This is the hardest speed to reach, burning much fuel, which would be otherwise in excess at landing
- climb from Mach 0.95 (28000 ft) to Mach 1.7 (47000 ft) lasts 10 minutes

_____________________Supersonic cruise_____________________
- from London-Heathrow, Mach 2 is reached 40 minutes - 650 NM (Bristol Channel) - after takeoff (A).
- cruise at Mach 2 consumes 20.5 tons/hour
- transatlantic flight at Mach 2 lasts 2 hours; 2h35 above Mach 1
- at FL500 Mach 2, slow climb rate of 50-60 ft/minute, to reduce fuel consumption

_____________________Supersonic descent____________________
- decelerate speed until 325-380 kt before starting the descent
- deceleration is started at 250 NM: 165 NM from Mach 2.0 FL580 to Mach 1.0 at FL350
- maintain the 50 ft climb rate to accelerate the deceleration
- slowly increase the descent rate, keeping the 325-380 kt speed: slow at FL580, higher at lower altitudes

__________________________Landing__________________________
- approach speed: 190 kt
- at 750 ft AGL, disable autopilot and autothrottle, keep the trim of the glide slope mode; maintain pitch at 10 degrees, control descent rate with speed (throttle)
- the tail wheel protects the reversers from hitting the ground
