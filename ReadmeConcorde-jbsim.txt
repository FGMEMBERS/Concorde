Concorde ops
============
Takeoff
-------
- the visor is raised not long after takeoff, to make cockpit quieter (A1).
- the visor protects the windscreen from the 125°C temperature at Mach 2 (A1).

Subsonic cruise
---------------
- Mach 0.93 at FL250, or Mach 0.95 at FL260 (full load) (B).

Supersonic climb
----------------
- start afterburner with VS at 3500 ft/minute; then progressively decrease until 700 ft/minute.
- at Mach 1.1, drag starts to decrease : prepare to increase the climb rate.
- stay inside the corridor of Mach/center of gravity. Below the minimum means a too high altitude for the current Mach
  speed : accelerate by reducing climb speed.
- at Mach 1.3, air intakes open progressively, providing additional thrust : prepare to increase the climb rate.
- climb from Mach 0.95 (28000 ft) to Mach 1.7 (47000 ft) lasts 10 minutes (A2).

Supersonic cruise
-----------------
- from London-Heathrow, Mach 2 is reached 40 minutes - 650 NM (Bristol Channel) - after takeoff (A3).
- cruise at Mach 2 consumes 20.5 tons/hour (E).
- transatlantic flight at Mach 2 lasts 2 hours; 2h35 above Mach 1 (A4).
- at FL500 Mach 2, slow climb rate of 50-60 ft/minute, to reduce fuel consumption (A3).

Supersonic descent
------------------
- decelerate speed until 325-380 kt before starting the descent (B).
- deceleration is started at 250 NM : 165 NM from Mach 2.0 FL580 to Mach 1.0 at FL350 (A3).
- maintain the 50 ft climb rate to accelerate the deceleration.
- maintain the 325-380 kt speed during the descent.

Landing
-------
- approach speed : 190 kt (A1).
- at 750 ft AGL, disable autopilot and autothrottle, keep the trim of the glide slope mode;
  maintain pitch at 10 degrees, control descent rate with speed (throttle).
- the tail wheel protects the reversers from hitting the ground (A1).


Consumption
===========
Consumption decreases with altitude, from FL500 to FL580 (60 ft/min. during 2h10).
Fuel must be just below 19000 kg with the direct route (short SID/STAR). So that it remains enough fuel, in case the
SID/STAR becomes long.

Decreasing the TSFC increases the range.


Customizing
===========
If your preferences.xml doesn't have 6 views, update Nasal/Concorde-views.xml and Nasal/Concorde-keyboard.xml.

Fuel load
---------
Default is maximum landing weight, 245000 lb (19000 kg fuel).
For maximum takeoff weight, 408000 lb (93000 kg fuel, London - New York), set /sim/presets/fuel to 1.
See other configurations in Nasal/Concorde-fuel.xml.

Sounds
------
See Sounds/concorde-real-sound.xml to install real Concorde sounds.

Frame rate
----------
The number of instruments is :
- optimized for a view at 55 degrees.
- minimum straight forwards the Captain heading (landing) : press "shift up arrow" to align the view.

Not essential panels can be put in comments in Models/Concorde_ba.xml : electric, hydraulic, pressurization, air bleed.


Keyboard
========
- "ctrl-D" : "D"isconnects the autopilot (button A/P DISC on the yoke).
- "ctrl-F" : a"F"terburner.
- "ctrl-Z" : virtual copilot (4 engines flame out).
- "d"      : air ground supply ("d"oor).
- "f"      : "f"ull cockpit (all instruments).
- "q"      : "q"uit speed up.

Views
-----
- "ctrl-E" : "E"ngineer view.
- "ctrl-J" : Copilot view.
- "ctrl-K" : Steward view.
- "ctrl-O" : "O"verhead view.

Unchanged behaviour
-------------------
- "left / right : changes autopilot heading.
- "x / X"  : zooms in the small fonts; reset with "ctrl-X".

Same behaviour
--------------
- "s"      : swaps between Captain and Center 2D panels.
- "ctrl-A" : "A"ltitude hold.
- "ctrl-G" : "G"lide slope.
- "ctrl-H" : "H"eading hold.
- "ctrl-N" : "N"av 1 hold.
- "ctrl-P" : "P"itch hold.
- "ctrl-S" : autothrottle.
- "g / G"  : "g"ear.

Improved behaviour
------------------
- "a / A" : speeds up BOTH speed and time. Until X 3.
            Automatically resets to 1, when above 3500 ft/min.

Alternate behaviour
-------------------
- "ctrl-B" : reverse thrust used as speedbrake (FDM not implemented).
- "[ / ]"  : nose used as flaps.
- "page up / page down" : increases / decreases speed hold, Mach hold.
- "up / down"  : increases / decreases (fast) altitude hold, vertical speed hold, pitch hold, speed hold with pitch,
   Mach hold with pitch.
- "home / end" : increases / decreases (slow) altitude hold, vertical speed hold, pitch hold, speed hold with pitch,
   Mach hold with pitch.


Mouse
=====
The 2D panel has simplified buttons for auxilliary tanks,
and engine start (without voltage and air bleed).

ADF
---
To update the frequency of ADF 2 :
- press "swap" at the bottom of the pedestal.
- press "ctrl-R" to call the radio menu. 

Autopilot
---------
- before pressing "TH" (track/heading), select "HDG" magnetic heading, or "TRK" true heading.
- "HH" (heading hold) is always magnetic.
- "MC" (max climb) sets the autothrottle to VMO (MMO above 50200 ft) (B).
  In case of overspeed, "Max Climb" will trigger "Speed with pitch", to return below the VMO.
- "AA" (altitude acquire) works by capture : the target altitude is reached, by another altitude mode ("PH", "VS").
- see Panels/Concorde-autopilot.xml (list of all buttons).
- the virtual copilot activates heading hold and speed with pitch, even if no voltage.

Electrical
----------
- autopilots and a few instruments depend of a particular ACC ESS BUS.

Engine
------
- to start an engine, activate the starter, before opening the HP VALVE (overhead).
  The starter requires air bleed, either from the ground service (open 1 cross bleed valve),
  or by its adjacent running engine (open 2 cross bleed valve).
  The starter is not required in flight (relight), if enough speed.
- the 1st engine start requires AC voltage, either from the ground service (steward view),
  or in flight (4 engines flame out) by the emergency generator :
  * activate the virtual copilot.
  * deploy the RAM Air Turbine : standby instruments work.
  * swap the 4 AC ESS bus to EMERG : other instruments work.
  * with the emergency relight busbar (below the starters), select the 1st engine to start.
  * relight the 1st engine, before opening its HP VALVE (overhead).
  * once the 1st engine started, restore the relight selector to off, and the 4 AC ESS to NORM.
  * start the 3 other engines.

Fuel
----
- the collector tanks 1 2 3 4 feed respectively engines 1 2 3 4.
- the main tanks 5 7 feed the collector tanks.
- "Aft" transfers forwards trim tanks (9, 10) to aft trim tanks (11).
  "Forward" does the reverse transfer (only to 9).
- "Engine" transfers trim tanks to the main tanks (5, 7) : choose the direction "Aft" or "Forw".
- the transfert valve feeds a main tank (5, 7) by its auxilliary tank (5A, 7A);
- "Jettison" (2 buttons for confirmation) dumps the trim (9, 10, 11) and collector tanks (1, 2, 3, 4) :
  isolate a trim tank by stopping its fuel pumps. 
- activate "Cross", to balance the dissymetrical tanks.
- "kg/h" checks that fuel pumping matches the fuel flow indicated by the engines.
- "T/O CG" : max performance takeoff at 54% CG, increases maximum center of gravity until Mach 0.45.

Hydraulics
----------
- nose, gear, brakes depend of green (up only) and yellow circuits.
- ground pumps require ground electrical power.

Inertial Navigation System
--------------------------
- INS indicates the fuel load at the waypoints.
- "2" (up) and "8" (down) scrolls the waypoints.
- "CLear" turns on/off the INS. 

Pressurization
--------------
- at least 1 air COND VALVE must be on, and pressurized by bleed air.

JSBSim
======
- maximum thrust (without air intakes) at FL500 is 10093 lb, matching the real value of 10000 lb !
- center of gravity inside corridor.
- the geometry is real data.
- tanks default at maximum takeoff weight (408000 lb).
- consumption London - New York : correct landing weight at KJFK.
- climb Mach 0.95 - 1.7 in 10 minutes.
- fuel around 20500 kg/h at Mach 2.02 (E).


TO DO
=====
- battery discharge.
- disable brakes and flight controls, when no hydraulics (joystick).
- control max cruise mode with TMO temperature (B).
- VRP at nose.

TO DO instruments
-----------------
- control of 2D instrument luminosity (only possible with 3D instruments).
- see Panels/Instruments/ReadmeInstruments.txt

TO DO JSBSim
------------
- reverse thrust is not implemented : ctrl-B only animates the lights and nozzles.
- aero reference point has its position of Mach 2.0 (static).
- disable intake, when no hydraulics.
- engine rating.
- additional drag when RAT.
- check the subsonic range.
- turbulence filter.
- abacus to fill the tanks, as function of aloft winds.

FDM update often implies a tuning of autopilot (mainly heading hold),
and always a complete test (autoland, subsonic, supersonic).


Known problems
==============

Known problems autopilot
------------------------
- heading hold a little slow to converge.
- if deviation is enough large (supersonic speed), close waypoint may not pop for the next one, to avoid a strong bank.
- engaged at 250 kt 10000 ft full load, altitude hold oscillates.
- autoland requires that glide slope is accurate until 100 ft AGL, and nav until 0 ft AGL (correct at KSFO 28R).
  However, to compensate the possible errors (red autoland lights), autoland ignores nav below 100 ft,
  and glide slope below 200 ft.
- log message "cannot override control.Throttleaxis", means that go around doesn't work on a platform.

Known problems instruments
--------------------------
- to open the cockpit door, use the F/D door switch (overhead).
- needles of Captain's VOR may work, while the failure flag of instrument is raised (discrepancy in voltages).

Known problems sound
--------------------
- exception through OpenAL errors (low hardware ?) means too many sounds :
  remove for example engine start/shutdown or external sounds.
  This is why engine shutdown/start sound is the same for all views.


Secondary problems
==================

Secondary problems JSBSim
--------------------------
- very light waddling at mach 2 (autopilot rudder trim, to solve roll of autopilot heading at Mach speeds).
- AoA at 180°, when one breaks strongly (empty tanks).
- disable yaw damper, when turbulence ?
- fuel consumption too low at idle (ground).
- oil pressure too high.

Secondary problems autopilot
----------------------------
- autopilot PID limits the speed up to X3.
- avoid autoland by gusty wind.
- confirm autoland landing speed, whatever the wind.
- joystick handler overridden to catch the goaround.

Secondary problems instruments
------------------------------
- shortcuts by a joystick button are not disabled (for example, lower gear only if hydraulics).
- cockpit lighting made with 3D instrument lighting.
- see Panels/Instruments/ReadmeInstruments.txt
