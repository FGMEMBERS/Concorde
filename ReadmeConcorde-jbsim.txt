Concorde ops
============
Takeoff
-------
- the visor is raised not long after takeoff, to make cockpit quieter (A1).
- the visor protects the windscreen from the 125°C temperature at Mach 2 (A1).

Subsonic cruise
---------------
- Mach 0.93 at FL250, or Mach 0.95 at FL260 (full load) (B).

Supersonic climb
----------------
- start afterburner with VS at 3500 ft/minute; then decrease at 2500-1500-1000-700 ft/minute.
- at Mach 1.1, drag starts to decrease : prepare to increase the climb rate.
- stay inside the corridor of Mach/center of gravity. Below the minimum means a too high altitude for the current Mach
  speed : accelerate by reducing climb speed.
- at Mach 1.3, air intakes open progressively, providing additional thrust : prepare to increase the climb rate.
- climb from Mach 0.95 (28000 ft) to Mach 1.7 (47000 ft) lasts 10 minutes (A2).

Supersonic cruise
-----------------
- from London-Heathrow, Mach 2 is reached 40 minutes - 650 NM (Bristol Channel) - after takeoff (A3).
- cruise at Mach 2 consumes 20.5 tons/hour (E).
- transatlantic flight at Mach 2 lasts 2 hours; 2h35 above Mach 1 (A4).
- at FL500 Mach 2, slow climb rate of 50-60 ft/minute, to reduce fuel consumption (A3).

Supersonic descent
------------------
- decelerate speed until 325-380 kt before starting the descent (B).
- deceleration is started at 250 NM : 165 NM from Mach 2.0 FL580 to Mach 1.0 at FL350 (A3).
- maintain the 50 ft climb rate to accelerate the deceleration.
- slowly increase the descent rate, keeping the 325-380 kt speed : slow at FL580, higher at lower altitudes.

Landing
-------
- approach speed : 190 kt (A1).
- at 750 ft AGL, disable autopilot and autothrottle, keep the trim of the glide slope mode;
  maintain pitch at 10 degrees, control descent rate with speed (throttle).
- the tail wheel protects the reversers from hitting the ground (A1).


Consumption
===========
Consumption decreases with altitude, from FL500 to FL580 (60 ft/min. during 2h10).
Fuel must be just below 19000 kg with the direct route (short SID/STAR). So that it remains enough fuel, in case the
SID/STAR becomes long.

Customizing
===========
If your preferences.xml doesn't have 6 views, update Concorde-views.xml and Concorde-keyboard.xml.

Fuel load
---------
Default is maximum landing weight, 245000 lb (19000 kg fuel).
For maximum takeoff weight, 408000 lb (93000 kg fuel, London - New York), set /sim/presets/fuel to 1.
See other configurations in Concorde-fuel.xml.

Sounds
------
See concorde-real-sound.xml to install real Concorde sounds.

Frame rate
----------
The number of instruments is :
- optimized for a view at 55 degrees.
- minimum straight forwards the Captain heading (landing) : press "shift up arrow" to align the view.

Not essential panels can be put in comments in Concorde_ba.xml : electrical, hydraulical, pressurization, air bleed.


Keyboard

- "ctrl-F" : a"F"terburner.
- 'ctrl-L" : virtual copi"L"ot (4 engines flame out).
- "q"      : resets speed up to 1.

Views
-----
- "ctrl-E" : "E"ngineer view.
- "ctrl-J" : Copilot view.
- "ctrl-K" : Steward view.
- "ctrl-O" : "O"verhead view.

Unchanged behaviour
-------------------
- "x / X"  : zooms in the small fonts; reset with "ctrl-X".

Same behaviour
--------------
- "s"      : swaps between Captain and Center 2D panels.
- "ctrl-A" : "A"ltitude hold.
- "ctrl-G" : "G"lide slope.

- "up / down"  : increases / decreases (fast) altitude hold, vertical speed hold, pitch hold, speed hold with pitch,
   Mach hold with pitch.
- "home / end" : increases / decreases (slow) altitude hold, vertical speed hold, pitch hold, speed hold with pitch,
   Mach hold with pitch.


Mouse
=====

Autopilot
---------
- before pressing "TH" (track/heading), select "HDG" magnetic heading, or "TRK" true heading.
- "HH" (heading hold) is always magnetic.
- "Max Climb" sets the autothrottle to VMO (MMO above 50200 ft) (B).
  In case of overspeed, "Max climb" will trigger "Speed with pitch" (to return below the VMO).
- See the panel file for capabilies of autopilot and autothrottle.
- the virtual copilot activates heading hold and speed with pitch, even if no voltage.

Inertial Navigation System
--------------------------
- INS indicates the consumption at the waypoints.
- "2" (up) and "8" (down) scrolls the waypoints.
- "CLear" turns on/off the INS. 

Engineer fuel
-------------
- the collector tanks 1 2 3 4 feed respectively engines 1 2 3 4.
- "Aft" transfers forwards trim tanks (9, 10) to aft trim tanks (11).
  "Forward" does the reverse transfer (only to 9).
- "Engine" transfers trim tanks to the main tanks (5, 7) : choose the direction "Aft" or "Forw".
- the transfert valve feeds a main tank (5, 7) by its auxilliary tank (5A, 7A);
- "Jettison" (2 buttons for confirmation) dumps the trim (9, 10, 11) and collector tanks (1, 2, 3, 4) :
  isolate a trim tank by stopping its fuel pumps. 
- activate "Cross", to balance the dissymetrical tanks.
- "kg/h" checks that fuel pumping matches the fuel flow indicated by the engines.
- "T/O CG" : max performance takeoff at 54% CG, increases maximum center of gravity until Mach 0.45.

2D panel only
.............
- "Aux" transfers both auxilliary tanks (5A, 7A).
- "105t"/"165t" reduces VMO and increases maximum center of gravity (105 t = 13900 kg fuel).

Engineer engine
---------------
- to start an engine, activate the starter, before removing the cutoff (overhead).
- the starter is not required if enough speed.
- the 1st engine start requires AC voltage, either from the ground service (steward view),
  or in flight (4 engines flame out) by the emergency generator :
  * activate the virtual copilot.
  * deploy the RAM Air Turbine : standby instruments work.
  * swap the 4 AC ESS bus to EMERG : other instruments work.
  * with the relight selector (below the starters), select the 1st engine to start.
  * start the 1st engine, by removing its cutoff (overhead).
  * once the 1st engine started, restore the relight selector to off, and the 4 AC ESS to NORM.
  * start the other engines.

ADF
---
To update the frequency of ADF 2 :
- press "swap" at the bottom of the pedestal.
- press "ctrl-R" to call the radio menu. 

ELectrical
----------
- voltage feeding of instruments or autopilot can depend of a particular AC ESS BUS.

Hydraulics
----------
- hydraulical operation can depend of a particular circuit color (green, yellow, blue).

JSBSim
======
- maximum thrust (without air intakes) at FL500 is 10093 lb, matching the real value of 10000 lb !
- center of gravity inside corridor.
- the geometry is real data.
- tanks default at maximum takeoff weight (408000 lb).
- consumption London - New York : correct landing weight at KJFK.
- climb Mach 0.95 - 1.7 in 10 minutes.
- fuel around 20500 kg/h at Mach 2.02 (E).


TO DO
=====
- adjust correctly the instrument plans, since there is no more vibration at supersonic speed.
- VRP.
- battery discharge.
- disable brakes and flight controls, when no hydraulics (joystick).
- control max cruise mode with TMO temperature (B).
- move some Nasal code into common C++/XML subsystems.

TO DO textures
--------------
- replace digital instruments by real analog 2D textures.
- review night vision : replace fonts by textures.
- 3D instruments, keeping the 3D cockpit complete (temporary cohabitation 2D/3D instruments).

TO DO JSBSim
------------
- no inverser at landing.
- aero reference point has its position of Mach 2.0 (static).
- additional drag when RAT.
- check the subsonic range.
- turbulence filter.
- abacus to fill the tanks, as function of aloft winds.
- no engine rating.

FDM updates often implies a tuning of autopilot (mainly heading hold),
and always a complete test (autoland, subsonic, supersonic).


Known problems
==============

Known problems JSBSim
---------------------
- very light waddling at mach 2 (autopilot rudder trim, to solve roll of autopilot heading at Mach speeds).
- fuel consumption too low at idle (ground).
- AoA at 180°, when one breaks strongly (empty tanks).
- cannot disable yaw damper.

Known problems autopilot
------------------------
- WARNING : if the autothrottle is hard to reach a target speed, check that the speedbrake (ctrl-B) is disabled ! 
- heading hold slightly slow to converge.
- if deviation is enough large (supersonic speed), close waypoint may not pop for the next one, to avoid a strong bank.
- autothrottles Mach/speed with pitch might need some tuning.
- engaged at 250 kt 10000 ft full load, altitude hold oscillates.
- avoid autoland by gusty wind.
- confirm autoland landing speed, whatever the wind and fuel weight.

Known problems 2D instruments
-----------------------------
- shortcuts by a joystick button are not disabled (for example, lower gear only if hydraulics).
- TCAS traffics have wrong bearing, when Concorde at rest.

Known problems 3D cockpit
-------------------------
- instruments have been disabled in external views, because there was transparent through aircraft (no alpha layer ?).
  Also because the clickable areas of the Captain view don't match those of the Engineer view :
  the instruments was exaggeratedly far to avoid vibration at supersonic speed.
- transparent textures have a darkener strip along one of their edges.

Known problems sound
--------------------
- exception through OpenAL errors (low hardware ?) means too many sounds :
  remove for example engine start/shutdown or external sounds.
  This is why engine shutdown/start sound is the same for all views.
