Concorde ops
============
Takeoff
-------
- the visor is raised not long after takeoff, to make cockpit quieter (A).
- the visor protects the windscreen from the 125°C temperature at Mach 2 (A).

Subsonic cruise
---------------
- Mach 0.93 at FL250, or Mach 0.95 at FL260 (full load) (B).

Supersonic climb
----------------
- start afterburner with VS at 3500 ft/minute; then decrease at 2500-1500-1000-700 ft/minute.
- at Mach 1.1, drag starts to decrease.
- stay inside the corridor of Mach/center of gravity. Below the minimum means a too high altitude for the current Mach
speed : accelerate by reducing climb speed.
- if required (pressure/temperature) after Mach 1.2, reduce at 100 ft/minute to break the Mach 1.3 final barrier.
- at Mach 1.3, air intakes open progressively, providing additional thrust. This is the hardest speed to reach,
burning much fuel, which would be otherwise in excess at landing.
- climb from Mach 0.95 (28000 ft) to Mach 1.7 (47000 ft) lasts 10 minutes (A).

Supersonic cruise
-----------------
- from London-Heathrow, Mach 2 is reached 40 minutes - 650 NM (Bristol Channel) - after takeoff (A).
- cruise at Mach 2 consumes 20.5 tons/hour (E).
- transatlantic flight at Mach 2 lasts 2 hours; 2h35 above Mach 1 (A).
- at FL500 Mach 2, slow climb rate of 50-60 ft/minute, to reduce fuel consumption (A).

Supersonic descent
------------------
- decelerate speed until 325-380 kt before starting the descent (B).
- deceleration is started at 250 NM : 165 NM from Mach 2.0 FL580 to Mach 1.0 at FL350 (A).
- maintain the 50 ft climb rate to accelerate the deceleration.
- slowly increase the descent rate, keeping the 325-380 kt speed : slow at FL580, higher at lower altitudes.

Landing
-------
- approach speed : 190 kt (A).
- at 750 ft AGL, disable the autopilot, keep the trim of the glide slope mode; control with speed and pitch, touch down
below 750 ft/minute : more speed enables to land with less pitch and vertical speed; more pitch reduces the descent rate.
- the tail wheel protects the reversers from hitting the ground (A).


Consumption
===========
It decreases with altitude, from FL500 to FL580 (60 ft/min. during 2h10).
Fuel must be just below 19000 kg with the direct route (short SID/STAR). So that it remains enough fuel, in case the
SID/STAR becomes long.

Cruise
------
Full at Mach 0.95 (530 kt true) FL260 : 19300 kg/h.
Average (depends of altitude) at Mach 2.02 : 20500 kg/h.
Empty at Mach 0.95 (525 kt true) FL380 : 12600 kg/h. 

To increase the range, decrease the Mach drag at Mach 2.0.


Customizing
===========
Set file has 2 configurations (max payload) :
- maximum landing weight, 245000 lb (19000 kg fuel).
- maximum takeoff weight, 408000 lb (93000 kg fuel, London - New York) : put in comment the US gallons
(inheritance from JBSim).

Sounds
------
concorde-real-sound.xml tells, how to install real Concorde sounds.


Keyboard
========
- "ctrl-D" : "D"isconnects the autopilot (button A/P DISC on the yoke).
- "ctrl-E" : toggles "E"ngineer/Captain view.
- "ctrl-F" : a"F"terburner.

Overriden
---------
- "s" swaps between Captain and Center 2D panels.
- nose used as flaps.
- "ctrl-A" : altitude hold.
- "ctrl-G" : glide slope.
- "ctrl-H" : heading hold.
- "ctrl-N" : nav 1 hold.
- "ctrl-P" : pitch hold.
- "ctrl-S" : autothrottle.
- "page up" : increases autothrottle (+/-22 kt, +/-0.06 Mach).
- "page down" : decreases autothrottle.
- "up" : increases pitch hold (+/- 11 deg).
- "down" : decreases pitch hold.

Engineer
--------
Tanks 1 2 3 4 feed respectively engines 1 2 3 4.
- "Aft" transfers forwards trim tanks (9 & 10) to aft trim tanks (11). "Forward" does the reverse transfer.
- "Engine" transfers trim tanks to the main tanks (5, 6, 7, 8, 5A & 7A) : choose the direction "Aft" or "Forw".
- "Jettison" (2 buttons for confirmation) dumps the rear tanks (11, 5A, 7A, 2 & 3).
- Activate "Cross", to balance the dissymetrical tanks.
- "kg/h" checks that fuel pumping matches the fuel flow indicated by the engines.
- "T/O CG" (Max performance takeoff at 54% CG) increases maximum center of gravity, from takeoff to Mach 0.45.
- "105t"/"165t" reduces VMO and increases maximum center of gravity (105 t = 13900 kg fuel).
- engine start : activate the starter, before removing the cutoff.

Inertial Navigation System
--------------------------
- INS indicates the consumption at the waypoints.
- "2" (up) and "8" (down) scrolls the waypoints.
- "CLear" turns on/off the INS. 

Alarms
------
- "Terrain" : too low gear (horn).
- "M/CG" : center of gravity out of corridor.
- "Speed" : overspeed (clink).

Autopilot
---------
- "HDG" is magnetic heading, and "TRK" true heading.
- "Max Climb" mode sets the autothrottle to VMO (MMO above 50200 ft) (B).
- See the panel file for capabilies of autopilot and autothrottle.
- At subsonic speed, no speed up above X 3.
- At supersonic speed, no speed up above X 2.


JBSim
=====
- maximum thrust (without air intakes) at FL500 is 10093 lb, matching the real value of 10000 lb !
- center of gravity inside corridor.
- the geometry is real data.
- tanks default at maximum takeoff weight (408000 lb).
- consumption London - New York : correct landing weight at KJFK.
- fuel around 20500 kg/h at Mach 2.02 (E).


TO DO
=====
- control max cruise mode with TMO temperature (B).
- reduce nasal code with Flightgear subsystems : Mach autopilot, fuel pumping, cross-feeding, cabine altitude, true
airspeed and ground speed.
- replace digital instruments by real analog textures.
- 3D instruments, keeping the 3D cockpit complete (temporary cohabitation 2D/3D instruments).
- missing in Flightgear : engine rating, 2 ADF, 2 DME.
- make transparent the external windows of cockpit.
- system failures.

TO DO JBSim
-----------
- turbulence filter.
- check the subsonic range.
- abacus to fill the tanks, as function of aloft winds.


Known problems
==============
- press "Aft" the first time to make the trim pumps working (Nasal bug ?).

Known problems JBSim
--------------------
- no inverser at landing.
- fuel consumption too low at idle (ground).
- aero reference point has its position of Mach 2.0 (static).
- very light waddling at mach 2 (autopilot rudder trim, to solve roll of autopilot heading at Mach speeds).
- AoA at 180°, when one breaks strongly (empty tanks).
- no support of engine rating.
- cannot disable yaw damper.
- cannot start engines, when they have runned out of fuel.

Known problems autopilot
------------------------
- near Mach 2, setting vertical speed at +60 ft/min, VSI doesn't match altimeter, which may even go down. While
/velocities/vertical-speed-fps, controlled by autopilot, is correct.
Example : for 30 ft/min, altimeter indicates 80 ft/min at FL500, and 50 ft/min at FL510.
Needs an IVSI (Instantaneous VSI), which works by pressure and matches the altimeter reading.
- confirm autoland landing speed, whatever the wind and fuel weight.
- avoid autoland by gusty wind.
- autothrottles Mach/speed with pitch might need some tuning.

Known problems 2D instruments
-----------------------------
- uniform lightning of artificial horizon's attitude warning, when negativ pitch.
- TCAS (radar) only works with 2D panel.

Known problems 3D cockpit
-------------------------
- instruments have been disabled in external views, because there are transparent through aircraft.
More gravely, copilot instruments hang outside the cockpit, because of a view shift to the right.
- the magnetic compass has some vibrations, because one cannot place it far forwards, otherwise the pillar hides the
ribbon (but not the black frame).
- pedestal and engineer panels have a few vibrations.

Known problems sound
--------------------
- fading with distance (tower views) doesn't work with engine real sounds.
- with low hardware, exception through OpenAL errors, when too many sounds : remove for example engine start/shutdown.
This is why engine shutdown/start sound is the same for all views.
